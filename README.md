### [Project 1: Covid Data Exploration: Project Overview](https://github.com/loughrc/CovidData)
A project data exploration and data visualisation
- Data retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
- Split data into two tables in order to carry out a comprehensive exploration using MySQL
- Explored data using a number of different types of MySQL operations (aggregate functions, joins, temp tables etc.)
- Made some visualisations of this data on Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/profile/conor.loughran#!/vizhome/Covid_Information_Worldwide/Dashboard1)
- Deeper data exploration using pandas (In Progress)

### [Project 2: Predicting Austin Animal Shelter Outcomes: Project Overview](https://github.com/loughrc/Austin_Animal_Shelter)
A simple data science project involving a basic data cleaning exercise and model building to predict the outcome for animals that resided in this shelter
- Carried out a simple data exploration using MySQL
- Created some visualisations of the data on Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/profile/conor.loughran#!/vizhome/Austin_Animal_Shelter/Dashboard1)
- Cleaned the data using the Python package pandas with prediction making in mind
- Compared the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers at predicting the outcome for an animal based on features such as animal type, age etc.

### [Project 3: Used Tractor Price Estimator (John Deere)](https://github.com/loughrc/JohnDeereData)
A project focused on data collection and using this model to create a regression model that estimates the price of an item based on other continuous features.
- Collected data relating to the pricing of John Deere tractors on the second hand market for model training
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict the cost of tractors based on a number of features
- More data is to be collected in order to make more accurate predictions: the data collection itself is still a work in progress
- Future plans include data manipulation and model tuning to increase accuracy once more data is collected, as well as a more comprehensive exploration using MySQL and data visualisation in Tableau.
