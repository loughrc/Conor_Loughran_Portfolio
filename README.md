### [Project 1: Covid Data Exploration: Project Overview](https://github.com/loughrc/CovidData)
A data exploration and data visualisation project where we look at data relating to Covid-19 infections in MySQL 
- Data retrieved from Our World In Data at the following [link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
- Split data into two tables in order to carry out a comprehensive exploration using MySQL
- Explored data using a number of different types of MySQL operations (aggregate functions, joins, temp tables etc.)
- Made some visualisations of this data on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/conor.loughran#!/vizhome/Covid_Information_Worldwide/Dashboard1)
- Deeper data exploration using pandas (In Progress)

### [Project 2: Predicting Austin Animal Shelter Outcomes: Project Overview](https://github.com/loughrc/Austin_Animal_Shelter)
A simple data science project involving a basic data cleaning exercise and model building to predict the outcome for animals that resided in this shelter
- Data retrieved from Kaggle at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and?select=aac_shelter_outcomes.csv)
- Carried out a simple data exploration using MySQL
- Created some visualisations of the data on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/conor.loughran#!/vizhome/Austin_Animal_Shelter/Dashboard1)
- Cleaned the data using the Python package pandas with prediction making in mind
- Compared the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers at predicting the outcome for an animal based on features such as animal type, age etc.

### [Project 3: Used Tractor Price Estimator (John Deere)](https://github.com/loughrc/JohnDeereData)
A project focused on data collection and using this data to create a regression model that estimates the price of an item based on other continuous features.
- Collected data relating to the pricing of John Deere tractors on the second hand market from [Farmers Weekly](https://classified.fwi.co.uk/used/a-Tractors/24/) adverts, ensuring that important features are collected
- Trained an AdaBoost regressor to predict the cost of tractors based on a number of features
- More data is to be collected in order to make more accurate predictions: the data collection itself is still a work in progress
- Future plans include data manipulation and model tuning to increase accuracy once more data is collected, as well as a more comprehensive exploration using MySQL and data visualisation in Tableau.


### [Project 4: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/loughrc/Nashville_Housing)
A data cleaning project based in SQL rather than Python, which uses housing data from Nashville, Tennessee, for the purposes of identifying price fluctuations in houses based on area location and house size 
- Imported data for cleaning into Microsoft SQL Server
- Carried out basic data exploration before cleaning data
- Cleaned data using a wide variety of SQL Operations (joins, CTEs, case functions etc.)
- Used Microsoft Excel to create pivot tables and visualisations of different trends found in the data

### [Project 5: Desktop Linux Distribution data: Project Overview](https://github.com/loughrc/CovidData)
This is a data collection project involving the creation of a relational database from the ground up using data relating to Desktop Linux Distributions, and visualising insights relating to the popularity scores and ratings of these distributions by the Linux community
- Collected data from [Distrowatch.com](https://distrowatch.com/) to store in an Excel spreadsheet
- Manually inserted this data into a relational database using Microsoft SQL Server
- Created visualisations of this data on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/conor.loughran/viz/MostPopularLinuxDistributionsAnalysisbasedonDistrowatch_com/Dashboard1)
